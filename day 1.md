1.	What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

a)	Safety and Security: Maximized security in the comparison to older languages
b)	Language syntaxis and semantic are more clear
c)	Approachability means easy adaptation for other languages programmers
d)	Developer Experience: Better error messages design makes debugging easier
e)	Resource Oriented Programming: I did not understand it yet, something like objects in other languages? 

2.	In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

As I see all of them are giving the better experience with lower costs, so why not.
