1. In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as Strings, and log it.

2. In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 that represents the order in which you
use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!

  pub fun main() {

    let people: [String] = ["Mom", "Me", "Jacob Tucker"]
    log(people)

    let map: {String: UInt64} = {"Reddit": 1, "LinkedIn": 1, "Facebook": 1, "Instagram": 2,
                                "Twitter": 2, "Youtube": 5}
  }
  
3. Explain what the force unwrap operator ! does, with an example different from the one I showed you (you can just change the type).
  Operator ! unwraps or, in other words, opens a cointainer where can be "nil" or "something", so I don't know yet where it can be useful, but I think that 
  it may be helpful in debugging.

4. Using this picture below, explain...
What the error message means
  It means, that function result is not "String" type, but should be, because you declared it 
Why we're getting this error
  Because String in Dictionary is wrapped Objective String?
How to fix it
  Unwrap String? with ! Operator:
    return thing[0x03]!
