Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.
  Because we can only "read" with the script

What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
  It means that transaction will be signed to access for AuthAccount objects like storage and keys.  

What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
  In the execute phase we can not access Authaccount objects, it is not necessary but recommended.

Add two new things inside your contract:
A variable named myNumber that has type Int (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)
A function named updateMyNumber that takes in a new number named newNumber as a parameter that has type Int and updates myNumber to be newNumber
 
   pub contract HelloWorld {

        pub var myNumber: Int

        init() {
            self.myNumber = 0
        }

        pub fun changeNumber(newNumber: Int) {
            self.myNumber = newNumber
        }
    }

Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract

    import HelloWorld from 0x01

    pub fun main(): Int {
      return HelloWorld.myNumber
    }

Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. Verify that your number changed by running the script again.

    import HelloWorld from 0x01

    transaction(myNewNumber: Int) {

      prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {}

      execute {
        HelloWorld.changeNumber(newNumber: myNewNumber)
      }
    }
